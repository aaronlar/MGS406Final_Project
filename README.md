# MGS406Final_Project
This is for my MGS406 Final Project
I am creating a call logging system to keep better track of the calls I am 
recieving and the time and date of them. To use this app you need to go to
IP address specified and press the "Log Call" button where you will be 
presented with the inputs of Time, Date, and Number, and Out or In. 
Out as in you are making the call and In if you recieved the call.
Then you will have the list option that will list all of the logged
calls.
